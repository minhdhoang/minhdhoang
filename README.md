## About me
I am Duc Minh Hoang, preferably called *Minh*. Currently, I am studying MSc Management and Business Analytics at Nottingham Trent University on a one-year course. Telling the story through data and creating stunning and insightful visualization is my aspiration, through which data will have more and more impact in the future!
Right now, I am working through my portfolio. Please see some of my projects below.
